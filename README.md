# coffee_map
Generate a KML map containing speciality coffee shops in Europe

# TODO:
1. read the existing KML file into a dictionary and look up search terms there before doing the google search.
1. stream results from Katana directly into the search
1. read from the actual ECT website name/address entries to make the search terms
1. setup github action to do a slow ECT scrape once a month
